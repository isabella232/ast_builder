# Asta

Asta (AST Amended) is a tool to make it easier to work with and compose S-Expressions and other AST related tasks in Ruby.

It relies heavily on RuboCop functionality, most notably of which the [`NodePattern`][0] meta-language for AST construction and matching.

## Usage

### Build

Asta supports direct strings, which is mostly done to generate ASTs more quickly from static strings.

```ruby
Asta.build('1 + 1')
```

The more typical usage for Asta involves passing it a block:

```ruby
Asta.build { s(:node_type, s(:child_node, '...')) }
=> #<Asta::Builder:0x00007fe2fba18390 @ast=s(:node_type, s(:child_node, "..."))>
```

Asta comes with several extensions to the standard `AST::Sexp` syntax's `s` method, as we'll be going over here.

### Expanded Nodes

Ruby constant strings and code that's mostly static can be a bit cumbersome to write out:

```ruby
puts Asta.build('A::B::C = 1')
(casgn
  (const
    (const nil :A) :B) :C
  (int 1))
=> nil
```

If you wanted to actually capture or use wildcards from [`NodePattern`][0] in that statement, it becomes more difficult:

```ruby
puts Asta.build('A::B::C = ...')
Asta::InvalidCode: The following node is invalid:
  'A::B::C = ...'
from /Users/baweaver/Development/asta/lib/asta/builder.rb:189:in 'parse'
```

Asta isn't quite smart enough to be able to tell the difference between a meta-character from [`NodePattern`][0] and a regular Ruby token. This is why the builder blocks are used, but in typical construction you would need to write out the expression by hand.

With Asta you can keep those larger nodes as normal Ruby:

```ruby
puts Asta.build { s(:casgn, expand('A::B'), :C, expand('1')) }
(casgn
  (const
    (const nil :A) :B) :C
  (int 1))
=> nil
```

### Literal Tokens

If [`NodePattern`][0] tokens aren't valid Ruby, how does one evaluate them into an s-expression tree? `RuboCop::AST::Node`, when coercing to a `String`, will call `inspect` on items it doesn't know how to coerce.

`Asta::LiteralToken` defines this in such a way to not have quotation marks, allowing for a psuedo-interpolation of the meta-language:

```ruby
puts Asta.build { s(:casgn, expand('A::B'), :C, literal('...')) }
(casgn
  (const
    (const nil :A) :B) :C ...)
=> nil
```

### Captures

If you want to capture a node, you would use `$` in NodePattern. In Asta we use `capture` to simulate the same:

```ruby
puts Asta.build { s(:casgn, expand('A::B'), :C, capture(literal('...'))) }
(casgn
  (const
    (const nil :A) :B) :C $...)
=> nil
```

There's the shorter version, `capture_children`, for this same task:

```ruby
puts Asta.build { s(:casgn, expand('A::B'), :C, capture_children) }
(casgn
  (const
    (const nil :A) :B) :C $(...))
=> nil
```

### Matching

An `Asta::Builder` can be coerced into a `RuboCop::NodePattern`, which can be used in the same fashion.

> Note: RuboCop has some slight inconsistencies with how it represents `nil`, which is why when
> coercing to a RuboCop::NodePattern syntax they're replaced with `nil?`.

```ruby
Asta.build { s(:casgn, expand('A::B'), :C, capture_children) }.to_cop
=> #<RuboCop::NodePattern:0x00007fe2fca004d8>
```

This means that you can use `match` just the same as you would on a `NodePattern`, but Asta surfaces this functionality as we'll see in the next section.

### match

Asta can directly match by coercing its internal state into a NodePattern:

```ruby
asta_build = Asta.build { s(:casgn, expand('A::B'), :C, capture_children) }

# Using Asta to build a quick AST mock:
match_data = asta_build.match(Asta.build('A::B::C = 1').to_ast)
=> s(:int, 1)

# Against a string:
asta_build.match('A::B::C = 1')
=> s(:int, 1)
```

This can also be used against nodes in a RuboCop rule match:

```ruby
module RuboCop
  module Cop
    # Grouping name of the Cop
    module Deprecations
      # Name of the check
      class AbcDeprecation < RuboCop::Cop::Cop

      # RuboCop takes a default message for errors
      MSG = '`A::B::C` is deprecated, use `D::E::F` instead.'

      # Saving the matcher as a constant allows for easier reuse if you use
      # autocorrect later, as well as giving a consistent theme across your
      # matchers.
      AST_MATCH = Asta.build { s(:casgn, expand('A::B'), :C, capture_children) }

      # [...]

      # Node matches work with the node type you're planning to capture. In this
      # case we're trying to capture a `casgn` from the top type of the expression:
      #
      #     (casgn
      #       (const
      #         (const nil :A) :B) :C
      #       (int 1))
      #
      # RuboCop matchers are all on_(type of node) for method names.
      def on_casgn(node)
        # Unless our node matches that expression, bail out.
        return false unless AST_MATCH.match(node)

        # If it did, add an offense so RuboCop knows it's bad.
        add_offense(node)
      end

      def autocorrect(node)
        # RuboCop passes this function to a batch that runs all the given
        # correctors for the code, hence returning a lambda here.
        -> corrector {
          matches = AST_MATCH.match(node)

          # 1. Matches are wrapped in an Enumerator, as there can be multiple
          # 2. Then the value you want may be in an S-Expression
          # 3. An S-Expression can have multiple children, so it's returned as an Array
          # 4. Getting the first value specifically gives us 1, the set value
          #
          #       [s()] -> s() -> [1]  ->  1
          value = matches.first.children.first

          # Now we could always use the actual s-expression from step 2 here
          # with `matches.first.location.source`, which is handy when we're
          # not dealing with only one integer.
          new_code = "D::E::F = #{value}"

          # You can use a few things here, like `insert_before` or after or
          # other expressions. See the corrector source for more ideas:
          #
          #   https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/blob/master/lib/rubocop/cop/corrector.rb
          #
          # In this case we're replacing the entire node where it's expression is,
          # or rather the entire thing, with our new code.
          corrector.replace(node.location.expression, new_code)
        }
      end
    end
  end
end
```
